# black_lamp- This is a repository for all the work we did for the past 3 weeks regarding the technical implementation of our project.

It contains the legitimate working AI and machine learning models and some failed attempts at creating our own models. 

We learned a lot, and we are really proud of what we achieved in this short period of time. 

You can find the recommendation system in our code and data folder and you can find everything you need to run the IBM glass recognition model in the IBM cloud folder.  

Keep in mind that everything that is on these folders is very necessary to running the code successfully. 

The work we did is publicly available here and we made sure to give all the credit where credit is due.

Thank you for your attention!
